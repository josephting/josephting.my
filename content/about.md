I am Joseph Ting. Originated from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia but currently based in Tokyo, Japan working as a Web Developer. If it's not related to creative side of designs, I can pretty much handle everything from programming to deployment to administration.

[Gaming](https://steamcommunity.com/id/josephting) is usually my go-to whenever I have free time.

Most if not all of the technologies were self-taught while referring to available resources online. With that said, I'm fairly confident in picking up new technologies independently albeit not up to mastery capability.
