Back in the 2000s, any content oriented websites would've been managed by some kind of CMS. This site was powered by WordPress but due to recent technology advancement mainly due to GitHub's Jekyll, static site generator became the norm for even highly content oriented websites like a web-based magazine site - [Smashing Magazine](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/03/16/smashing-magazine-just-got-10x-faster/).

With that in mind, I've been working on revamping my personal WordPress powered site into a static site which is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

One of the main benefit I'm taking advantage of here is I no longer have to pay for web hosting cost since [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is hosting this site free of charge.

I'm so excited of what is there to come in the future years as more and more of the tedious tasks are being handled by the computers while we're focusing on the creative part where automation is more challenging.
